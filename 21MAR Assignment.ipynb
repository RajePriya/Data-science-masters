    "Ans:- Both Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical data. However,\n",
    "they differ in how they treat the values of the categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding assigns a unique integer to each category in the variable. For example, if we have a categorical variable \n",
    "\"Color\" with values [\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\"], Label Encoding would map \"Red\" to 0, \"Blue\" to 1, and \"Green\" to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding, on the other hand, assigns an integer value to each category based on its order or rank. For example, \n",
    "if we have a categorical variable \"Education\" with values [\"High School\", \"Bachelor's Degree\", \"Master's Degree\", \"PhD\"],\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding would map \"High School\" to 0, \"Bachelor's Degree\" to 1, \"Master's Degree\" to 2, and \"PhD\" to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we would use Ordinal Encoding when the categories have a clear order or rank, such as education level or age \n",
    "group. We would use Label Encoding when there is no intrinsic order to the categories, such as color or gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a dataset about job applicants, we might use Ordinal Encoding for the \"Education\" variable because there is\n",
    "a clear rank to the education levels. However, for the \"Gender\" variable, we would use Label Encoding because there is no\n",
    "inherent order to male or female."

    "Ans:- Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique for encoding categorical variables that can be used when the categories\n",
    "have a natural ordering and the target variable is binary or ordinal. The idea behind this technique is to replace each \n",
    "category with a number that reflects the relationship between that category and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the step-by-step process for implementing Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Calculate the mean of the target variable for each category of the categorical feature.\n",
    "=> Sort the categories in ascending order based on their mean target variable values.\n",
    "=> Assign an ordinal number to each category based on its position in the sorted list.\n",
    "For example, suppose you are working on a project to predict whether a customer will buy a product or not based on their age\n",
    "group. You have a dataset with a categorical feature called \"Age Group,\" which has the following categories: \"Under 18,\" \n",
    "\"18-24,\" \"25-34,\" \"35-44,\" \"45-54,\" and \"Over 54.\" You can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to encode this feature as \n",
    "follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Calculate the mean of the target variable (buy or not buy) for each category of \"Age Group.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Sort the categories in ascending order based on their mean target variable values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Under 18: 0.20\n",
    "18-24: 0.25\n",
    "25-34: 0.30\n",
    "35-44: 0.35\n",
    "45-54: 0.40\n",
    "Over 54: 0.45\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Assign an ordinal number to each category based on its position in the sorted list:\n",
    "\n",
    "Under 18: 1\n",
    "18-24: 2\n",
    "25-34: 3\n",
    "35-44: 4\n",
    "45-54: 5\n",
    "Over 54: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be used to capture the relationship between age and the probability of a\n",
    "customer buying a product. The resulting encoded feature can then be used as input to a machine learning algorithm."

    "Ans:- Covariance is a measure of the relationship between two variables. It measures how much two variables change together. \n",

    "while the other decreases, they have a negative covariance. If there is no relationship between the variables, their \n",

    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps us understand how variables are related to each other. For\n",
    "example, if we are trying to predict the price of a house, we might look at how variables like the size of the house, the\n",
    "number of bedrooms, and the location of the house are related to each other. If two variables have a high positive \n",
    "covariance, we might use that information to make a more accurate prediction.\n",
