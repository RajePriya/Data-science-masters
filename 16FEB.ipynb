    "Ans:- \n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that enables efficient \n",
    "retrieval and manipulation of the data. Databases are commonly used in many areas of computing, including business,\n",
    "science, and entertainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases, also known as relational databases, store data in tables with rows and columns, where each row \n",
    "represents a unique record and each column represents a specific piece of data. The tables are then linked to \n",
    "each other using relationships defined by foreign keys. SQL databases use a query language called Structured Query\n",
    "Language (SQL) to access and manipulate the data. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft\n",
    "SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational and do not store data in tables. Instead, they use various \n",
    "data models, including document-oriented, key-value, column-oriented, and graph-based models, to store data in a\n",
    "flexible and scalable way. NoSQL databases typically offer better performance and scalability than SQL databases,\n",
    "making them a popular choice for handling large amounts of unstructured data. However, NoSQL databases may not \n",
    "offer the same level of consistency and reliability as SQL databases. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB,\n",
    "Cassandra, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the\n",
    "type and volume of data, the need for scalability, and the desired level of consistency and reliability. SQL \n",
    "databases are often a good choice for applications that require strong consistency and structured data, while\n",
    "NoSQL databases are often a good choice for applications that require flexibility, scalability, and handling of\n",

    "A Primary Key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identify each row in a table. The values in a primary\n",

    "For example, consider a table named \"students\" that contains information about students in a school. Each student \n",

    "Ans:- The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> FROM clause: The FROM clause is executed first, which specifies the table or tables from which data will be \n",
    "retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> WHERE clause: The WHERE clause is executed next, which filters the rows returned by the FROM clause based on a \n",
    "specified condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> GROUP BY clause: The GROUP BY clause is executed next, which groups the rows returned by the WHERE clause based\n",
    "on one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> HAVING clause: The HAVING clause is executed next, which filters the grouped rows based on a specified condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> SELECT clause: The SELECT clause is executed next, which specifies the columns to be returned in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> DISTINCT clause: If the DISTINCT keyword is used in the SELECT clause, duplicate rows are removed from the result\n",
    "set.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> ORDER BY clause: The ORDER BY clause is executed next, which sorts the result set based on one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "=>LIMIT clause: If the LIMIT keyword is used, the result set is limited to a specified number of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some clauses, such as the WHERE and HAVING clauses, can be used multiple times in a single query to \n",
    "further filter the result set. The order of execution may also be affected by the use of subqueries or joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, understanding the order of execution of SQL clauses is important for optimizing query performance and \n",
    "ensuring that the correct data is retrieved from the database."
