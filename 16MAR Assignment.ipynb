    "Ans:- Overfitting and underfitting are two common problems that can occur when building machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data and begins to fit the noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern. \n",
    "In other words, the model learns the training data so well that it becomes too specialized and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. This can \n",
    "result in poor performance on the test data and a lack of ability to make accurate predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying pattern in the data. This results in poor\n",
    "performance on both the training and test data, and the model may not be able to make accurate predictions on any data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consequences of overfitting are that the model will perform well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. This can lead to a lack of \n",
    "trust in the model and poor performance in real-world applications. The consequences of underfitting are that the model will perform poorly on all \n",
    "data, including the training data, and will not be useful for any predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate overfitting, one can use techniques such as regularization, which adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage overly complex\n",
    "models, or dropout, which randomly drops out nodes in the model during training to prevent it from relying too heavily on any one feature.\n",

    "=> Learning curves: Learning curves are a useful visualization tool for detecting overfitting and underfitting. A learning curve plots the performance\n",
    "of the model on the training and validation data as a function of the number of training examples. If the model is overfitting, the training error\n",
    "will continue to decrease while the validation error will increase. If the model is underfitting, both the training and validation errors will be high\n",
    "and may plateau.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique for estimating the performance of a model on new, unseen data. By partitioning the data into \n",
    "training and validation sets multiple times and averaging the results, we can get a more accurate estimate of the model's performance. If the model \n",

    "=> L2 regularization: L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model weights. This \n",
    "encourages the model to use smaller weights, effectively smoothing the output and reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks. During training, random neurons are \"dropped out\" of the network\n",
    "with a specified probability. This encourages the network to learn more robust features by preventing co-adaptation of neurons.\n",
