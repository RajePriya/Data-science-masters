    "Ans:- There are several methods used for web scraping, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Manual scraping: This involves manually copying and pasting data from web pages into a spreadsheet or database. \n",
    "This method is time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it can be useful for small-scale scraping projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> XPath: This is a query language used to extract data from XML documents, including HTML. It allows you to select specific\n",
    "elements on a web page by navigating its HTML structure, and extract the text or attributes associated with those elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Regular expressions: Regular expressions are patterns used to match and extract specific text from a string. They can be \n",
    "used to extract data from HTML tags or other structured data on a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> DOM parsing: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that allows you to manipulate HTML and XML \n",
    "documents. By using DOM parsing libraries such as BeautifulSoup or lxml in Python, you can extract data from web pages\n",
    "by navigating the HTML structure and selecting specific elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> APIs: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access data in a \n",
    "structured format. APIs can provide a more reliable and efficient way of extracting data from websites, as they are designed\n",
    "for programmatic access.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Headless browsing: This involves using a headless browser like PhantomJS or Selenium to simulate a user interacting with\n",
    "a website. By programmatically navigating a website and interacting with its elements, you can extract data that would be \n",
    "difficult or impossible to obtain using other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while web scraping can be a useful tool, it is important to respect the terms of service and \n",
    "legal restrictions of the websites you are scraping, and to obtain permission if necessary. Some websites may have measures\n",
    "in place to prevent scraping, and scraping large amounts of data can put a strain on their servers and potentially harm \n",
    "their performance."
