    "Ans:- The partitioning of variance is a key concept in ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) that explains how the total variation in a dependent variable\n",

    "variation:\n",

    "=> Within-group variation: This is the variation in the dependent variable that is due to differences within the groups being compared. For \n",

    "However, different methods of handling missing data can have varying consequences on the results. Mean imputation assumes that the missing data\n",

    "results. Multiple imputation is considered to be one of the best methods to handle missing data, but it can be computationally intensive.\n",
