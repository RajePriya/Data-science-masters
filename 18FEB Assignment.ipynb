    "Ans:- An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software \n",
    "applications. It specifies how different software components should interact with each other. APIs allow different \n",
    "software applications to communicate with each other and exchange data and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of where an API is used in real life is in social media platforms. Social media platforms like Facebook,\n",
    "Twitter, and Instagram all provide APIs that allow third-party developers to build applications that can interact\n",
    "with their platform. These APIs allow developers to build applications that can read and write data to and from \n",
    "the social media platform. For example, a developer can build an application that allows users to post updates to\n",
    "their Facebook page or retrieve data from their Twitter account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of where APIs are used is in the financial industry. Financial institutions like banks and stock\n",
    "exchanges use APIs to provide access to their financial data and services. For example, a developer can use a \n",
    "bank's API to build an application that allows users to check their account balance, transfer funds, or pay bills.\n",
    "Similarly, a developer can use a stock exchange's API to build an application that allows users to retrieve stock \n",
    "prices and trade stocks.\n",

    "each other, exchange data and services, and provide additional functionality to end-users."
