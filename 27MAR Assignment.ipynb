    "Ans:- While regularized linear models can be effective in many situations, they do have some limitations that may \n",
    "make them less appropriate in certain cases. Some limitations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Limited feature selection: Regularized linear models shrink the coefficients of all features towards zero, which\n",
    "can lead to some features being completely eliminated from the model. While this can improve model interpretability\n",
    "and prevent overfitting, it can also result in a loss of information and reduced feature selection.\n",

    "relationships between the predictors and the target variable. In such cases, more complex models such as decision\n",
    "trees or neural networks may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Choosing the regularization parameter: The regularization parameter needs to be chosen carefully to achieve \n",
    "optimal model performance. If the regularization parameter is set too high, the model may be underfitting the data \n",
    "and have poor predictive performance. Conversely, if the regularization parameter is set too low, the model may be\n",
    "overfitting the data and still have poor generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Outliers and extreme values: Regularized linear models can be sensitive to outliers and extreme values in the \n",
    "data, which can have a significant impact on the model coefficients and performance.\n",
