    "Ans:- Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format or representation to another. In data science, data \n",
    "encoding is useful for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Machine Learning: Machine learning models work with numerical data, and encoding categorical data into numerical data is \n",
    "a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Storage: Encoding data can help reduce storage space by compressing data into a more compact format.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Data Integration: Data encoding can help to integrate data from multiple sources with different formats into a single\n",
    "data format.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Data Security: Encoding data can be used as a form of encryption to protect sensitive information by transforming it into\n",
    "an unreadable format.\n",
