The softmax function is commonly used in multi-class classification tasks to make the final predictions more interpretable and to handle scenarios where there are multiple possible classes that an input can belong to.\n",

Understanding these challenges and knowing how to address them is crucial for successful training. Some common challenges and their solutions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vanishing Gradients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Issue: In deep neural networks with many layers, the gradients can become very small as they are propagated backward through the layers. This is known as the vanishing gradients problem. It can cause the weights in the early layers to update very slowly, leading to slow or stalled learning.\n",
    "- Solution: Use activation functions that mitigate vanishing gradients, such as ReLU or variants like Leaky ReLU. Additionally, employing normalization techniques like Batch Normalization can help stabilize gradients during training.\n",
    "2. Exploding Gradients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Issue: The opposite of vanishing gradients, the exploding gradients problem occurs when gradients become extremely large, causing weight updates to be too substantial and leading to instability during training.\n",
    "- Solution: Implement gradient clipping, which sets a threshold on the gradient values during backpropagation, preventing them from exceeding a predefined limit. Gradient clipping helps maintain stable updates and prevents the gradients from exploding.\n",
    "3. Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Issue: Overfitting occurs when the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. This can happen if the model is too complex and memorizes the training examples instead of learning general patterns.\n",
    "- Solution: Employ regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization to penalize large weights, reducing model complexity and promoting generalization. Additionally, using dropout during training can help prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out some neurons during each iteration.\n",
    "4. Learning Rate Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Issue: The learning rate is a critical hyperparameter that determines the step size in weight updates. An incorrect learning rate can lead to slow convergence or oscillations during training.\n",
    "- Solution: Experiment with different learning rates using learning rate schedules or adaptive optimizers like Adam, which automatically adjust the learning rate during training based on past gradient updates.\n",
    "5. Unstable Loss Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Issue: Some loss functions can be numerically unstable, leading to very high or low gradients and making training difficult.\n",
    "- Solution: Choose appropriate loss functions that are well-suited for the task at hand and do not suffer from numerical instability. Cross-entropy loss is commonly used for classification problems and is usually numerically stable.\n",
    "6. Gradient Calculation in Non-Differentiable Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Issue: In some neural network architectures, certain layers or operations may be non-differentiable, making it challenging to compute gradients.\n",
