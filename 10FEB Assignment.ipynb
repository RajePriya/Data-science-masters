    "Ans:- close() is a function used to close a file. It is important to close a file because it releases system resources associated with the file, such as memory and disk space. When a file is not closed properly, the memory associated with it may not be released, potentially causing memory leaks, which can lead to system instability. Additionally, if the file is not closed properly, any changes made to the file may not be saved, meaning any data added or modified may be lost."
