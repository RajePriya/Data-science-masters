    "Ans:- Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that is used to address the issue of multicollinearity in the\n",
    "data. It differs from ordinary least squares regression (OLS) in that it adds a penalty term to the loss function,\n",
    "which prevents the model from overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OLS, the goal is to minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE) between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "However, in the presence of multicollinearity, the OLS estimator can become unstable, leading to high variance and\n",
    "potentially large errors in the estimated coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression addresses this problem by adding a penalty term to the SSE, which is proportional to the square of\n",
    "the magnitude of the coefficients. The penalty term is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization \n",
    "parameter, which determines the strength of the penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing this penalty term, Ridge Regression is able to shrink the magnitude of the coefficients towards \n",
    "zero, reducing the impact of multicollinearity and making the model more stable. This penalty term introduces a \n",
    "bias in the estimation of the coefficients, but it also reduces the variance of the estimator, resulting in a more \n",
    "reliable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Ridge Regression is a powerful technique for handling multicollinearity in the data and improving the \n",
    "stability of the model. However, it does require setting the value of the regularization parameter, which may \n",
    "require tuning via cross-validation to obtain the best performance."

    "Ans:- The assumptions of Ridge Regression are similar to those of ordinary linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables should be linear.\n",
    "=> Independence: The observations should be independent of each other.\n",
    "=> Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
