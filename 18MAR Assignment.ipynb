    "Ans:- The Filter method is a feature selection technique that involves selecting features based on some statistical measure \n",
    "or scoring function. It works by ranking the features based on their relevance to the target variable or by measuring their\n",
    "correlation with other features in the dataset. The Filter method does not involve any machine learning algorithm and is \n",
    "typically applied before training a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filter method consists of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Feature ranking: This step involves calculating a score or statistical measure for each feature in the dataset. The \n",
    "ranking can be done using various methods such as correlation, mutual information, chi-squared, Fisher score, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Feature selection: In this step, a threshold is set, and features with scores above the threshold are selected for the\n",
    "final dataset. The threshold can be set manually or using some statistical method such as selecting the top k features or\n",
    "selecting features with scores above a certain percentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Model training: The final dataset, consisting of the selected features, is used to train a machine learning model. The \n",

    "The advantages of the Filter method are that it is computationally efficient, does not require any domain knowledge or model\n",

    "Ans:- Embedded feature selection methods are algorithms that incorporate feature selection as part of the model training\n",
    "process. These methods select the most relevant features while training the model, leading to a reduction in the feature \n",
    "space and improved model performance. Some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Lasso regularization: Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regularization technique used in \n",
    "linear regression that adds a penalty term to the cost function, which encourages the model to select only the most \n",
    "important features. The Lasso technique can be used to select relevant features and eliminate irrelevant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Ridge regularization: Ridge regression is another regularization technique that adds a penalty term to the cost function,\n",
    "which encourages the model to reduce the magnitude of the coefficients. Ridge regression can be used to select features that\n",
    "have a significant impact on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Decision Trees: Decision Trees are a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model of decisions and \n",
    "their possible consequences. Decision Trees can be used for feature selection by analyzing the importance of each feature in\n",
    "the model.\n",

    "Ans:- While the Filter method is a quick and easy way to perform feature selection, there are some drawbacks to using this \n",
    "approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Ignores feature interactions: The Filter method evaluates each feature independently of the others, which means it \n",
    "doesn't take into account any interactions or correlations between features. This can lead to selecting redundant features \n",
    "and missing out on important interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Ignores the target variable: The Filter method uses statistical tests or other measures to evaluate the importance of \n",
    "features, but it doesn't consider how well the features predict the target variable. This can lead to selecting features \n",
    "that are not useful in predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Fixed threshold: The Filter method relies on a fixed threshold to select features, which may not be appropriate for all \n",
    "datasets. If the threshold is set too low, irrelevant features may be selected, while if it is set too high, important \n",
    "features may be missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Sensitivity to feature scaling: The Filter method can be sensitive to the scale of the features, which can affect the \n",
    "results of statistical tests and measures used to evaluate feature importance. It's important to normalize or scale the \n",
    "features before applying the Filter method to ensure accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Limited to linear relationships: The Filter method is limited to detecting linear relationships between features and the\n",
    "target variable. If there are non-linear relationships present in the data, the Filter method may not be able to identify \n",
    "them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Filter method can be a useful approach to perform feature selection, but it's important to keep in mind its \n",
    "limitations and potential drawbacks. Other feature selection methods, such as Wrapper and Embedded methods, may be more \n",
    "appropriate for certain datasets and modeling tasks."
