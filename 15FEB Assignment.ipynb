    "In a nutshell, multiprocessing creates several processes, which are separate instances of the same program running at the same time, each with its \n",

    "different threads share the same memory space and resources of the process and run concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Overhead: Multiprocessing has more overhead than multithreading, as the creation of new processes involves more system resources than the creation \n",
    "of new threads. However, multiprocessing can take better advantage of multi-core CPUs and distribute the workload across them, which can lead to\n",
    "better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Isolation: Processes in multiprocessing are completely isolated from each other, whereas threads in multithreading share the same memory space and\n",
    "resources, which can lead to synchronization issues and potential race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Memory: Because multiprocessing creates separate processes, each process has its own memory space, which can help prevent memory conflicts. \n",
    "In multithreading, threads share the same memory space, which can lead to memory-related issues like deadlock or data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Complexity: Multithreading is generally considered to be more complex than multiprocessing, as threads need to coordinate with each other more\n",

    "In summary, multiprocessing and multithreading have different strengths and weaknesses, and which one to choose depends on the specific requirements \n",
